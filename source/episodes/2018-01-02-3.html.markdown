#### Summary

Don faced an issue at his startup job: When should you slow down forward progress on new features in order to spend time on festering technical issues?

#### Notes

* Randy discusses his explosion of side projects: An app for HOA board members, an open source project named [CaptionPoint](http://www.captionpoint.com), a marketing app for a service provider
* Randy states that his two-week break is no longer viable
* Don discusses the efforts needed to automate tasks for AspirEDU
* Don throws out the topic "How do you go about making the decision to make the trade off of slowing down new development to tackle old code and inefficiencies"
* Both Don and Randy agree this topic pertains to more-established firms rather than startups (the pre-optimization problem)
