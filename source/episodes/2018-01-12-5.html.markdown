Don brings up the subject of chaos, based on a book he's been reading, Antifragile, by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. We discuss the merits of test driven development, unpredictability, and how technical managers can work towards a more resilient product in the face of inevitable failures.

#### Notes

* Antifragile represents a system that improves under chaos
* In a well-tuned org, with test cases and adaptive practives, software systems can improve under chaos
* Netflix and Amazon built their systems with chaos in mind. Expect failure and build with failovers.
* For a system to be antifragile, its parts must be fragile
* To build a resilient backend can be very costly
* Asking the executive team about what's feasible for downtime vs the costs of a completely redundant system is a good starting point
* Understand what the business needs are during a failure event
* Test-driven development can help a firm quickly visualize how changes made cause butterfly effects across a system
* The conversation moved towards the subject of complacency, which will be expanded upon in a later episode
