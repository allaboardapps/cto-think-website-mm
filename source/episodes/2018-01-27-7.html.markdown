How important is a work-life balance for a technology career?

READMORE

#### Notes

* We've launched a Patreon campaign to raise funds for per-episode transcripts.
* Some people feel the need to adhere to a strict 9-to-5.
* The source of the rigid 9-to-5 work-life balance theories are important to consider.
* Wealthy folks, or folks that have already "made it" may have a different perspective than folks trying to now launch a company.
* Do the people touting a balanced philosophy, now, did they follow that same philosophy when they were working their way up?
* People that have mastered a craft may not have a lot more to learn.
* The work/life philosophy out of Silicon Valley stems from the investor/investee relationship and expectations.
* The strictly 9-to-5 philosophy can feel very restraining to some people.
* If a person has the goals to be in an innovative field, to make more money, and to manage more people, and their philosophy is strictly a 9-to-5 learning program, good luck to that.
* The life constraints that people face: multiple jobs, debt, family, health, all weigh on a person's ability to focus on learning outside of a standard workday timeline.
* Don recommends a book named [Shadow Divers, by Robert Kurson]("https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0739320831/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0739320831&linkCode=as2&tag=allaboardapps-20&linkId=7e895f36f4a157b186fc9d0f506cddd3")
* Randy recommends a newsletter called [SoftwareLeadWeekly, publised by Oren Ellenbogen](https://www.softwareleadweekly.com)
