#### Notes

* Don is headed to Gainesville for the [Gator 100](https://gator100.ufl.edu/home) ceremonies where both of his firms are being recognized as top 100 firms for growth by University of Florida alumni
* Randy worked as a substitute teacher for the [Northwestern Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.northwestern.edu/coding) full-time program for two days
* AspirEDU went straight to Heroku for their hosting
* Randy started with a desktop computer that sat in the middle of the room, to a closet rack system, to outsourced co-location
* Some of the biggest negatives of cloud vs in-house is cost or lack of control/flexibility
* When Amazon Web Services East goes down, everyone seems to be going down at the same time, but you can let AWS techs take care of it
* Nobody seems to talk about the dev ops people required to run a system if you switch away from a managed provider
* Everytime you need to go directly to AWS, there's a significant time investment to get things launched
* The less work our team handled on-site or on-team always had benefits from an efficiency standpoint
* Thanks to Jeremy Lasich for his contribution to our [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/ctothink) to produce transcripts for each episode.
