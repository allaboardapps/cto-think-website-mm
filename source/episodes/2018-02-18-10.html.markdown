#### Notes

* Don is working on a communications tool for Construction Specialties & Design
* Randy was recently hired as a Fractional CTO for a startup
* A question in an external discussion was posed: Why are there so few good managers in technology?
* Enova, a financial firm based out of Chicago, has created clear engineering and leadership paths for their technology team
* Empathy is a clear requirement for good leadership
* "Constantly put yourself in other people's shoes. If you can think about someone else or their situation removed from yourself, that's what you're aiming for."
* Empathy for both the people working under you and those other people above your, or clients, is all important.
* Understanding stakeholders is another big step to move up the ladder
* Understand their motivations and their needs. Different judgement metrics are put upon different roles and your ability to help your manager meet those metrics can move you up the ladder.
* Be able to shape-shift depending on various situations.
* Junior developers are not privvy to meetings where other stakeholders are involved. How does someone shut out of the meetings get in front of different stakeholders?
* Start with whom you are connected to, to your close manager. Eventually, more responsibility will come your way.
* It's a little about hustle, as well. Find out what your best traits are and work doubly hard at those skills for the team.
* Get out of the office and meet the different stakeholders that you don't have access to at your current job.
* Go to meetups that don't necessarily include the same exact people as yourself.
* Meet startup founders, executives, managers, designers, etc that you'll need to work with down the road.
* Teaching people that are greener than yourself at a particular skill will open up your experience with people that you'll need to manage or teach in the future.
* Get to know users, the problems they face, the tech they use, which are closer to the client or userbase of other products or firms.
* Most people at meetups are also introverts. You can be as quiet as you want until you get comfortable.
* Understanding yourself, your anxieties, how your energy with other people work, how other people respond to you.
* Knowing where you fit on the extrovert, introvert spectrum is very helpful for knowing how you can work better with other people.
* Staying calm in a frantic situation can sometimes be perceived as "not caring" rather than "I'm taking care of this problem"
* Mark Richt was at the University of Georgia for fifteen years and was frequently criticized for his lack of reaction during game losses.
* Technical leaders move up the ladder faster because they have excellent people working for them. It's not only a product of managing people well, but bring
* Outsourcing the hiring process to Human Resources or recruiters is the first point of failure
* Recruiting is the lifeblood of your team's talent and productivity
* It is upon every person moving up the ladder to understand the hiring process and take ownership of adding better people to their teams.
* Understand what it costs to get good people
* Talk to recruiters about how they go about their jobs
* Understand how your company brings people into interviews
* Finding good people will set the tone of productivity for your teams and it's imperative for you to own the process of doing that
* Getting to understand the variety of other personalities out there helps learn about the variety of folks you need to manage
* Two other areas for another episode: Project management for developers and project management for managers
* Training and teaching are extremely important for a management role where the labor market is tight. Growing a team and teaching green to great is important for technical leadership roles.

#### Recommendations

* Don recommends a blog post on Medium by Paul Robinson, [The Problems of the CTO Role](https://medium.com/@p7r/the-problems-of-the-cto-role-c2a143a1cec7), which talks about the CTO job, how people got into the job and the ways in which it is broken
* Randy recommends the [SimpleNote app](https://simplenote.com/) and service
