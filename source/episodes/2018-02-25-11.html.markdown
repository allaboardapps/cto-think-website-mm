Are code challenges or quizzes a legitimate practice for hiring developers? We debate whether the method of filtering candidates via whiteboarding or code games is plain lazy or necessary part of the recruiting process for engineers.

#### Notes

* Randy is frank: taking a code quiz for a leadership or senior tech role is beneath his experience and skill-level
* A developer's body of work speaks to their ability to build and lead, not FizzBuzz
* Randy: Code challenges are lazy hiring.
* What do you look at? The body of work a developer has done. What do they advertise as work that represents them?
* Has this person been in a position for the role I'm hiring for? Will a coding quiz tell you that?
* Look at a candidate's resume, blog, and personal website or simply ask them
* Github repos are dumping grounds for scripts and not a great place to review someone's quality code
* Ask the person to provide examples of project they work on
* People can't show proprietary code from a company they work for, and you don't want them to
* If a person has not been able to build things, then a test to show technical aptitude may be warranted
* A green-level dev, in an audition process, must be judged with the idea that such tests are create anxiety
* Do you really want to hire someone who spends all their time preparing for coding tests?
* Don's team at AspirEDU brings in the developer, walks through prior experience, and then offers to pay them to come in and spend time working on a small project, and solve the issue
* A good crop of exceptional developers are already employed and have a high demand for their skills
* If the only part of the tech pool you're looking at are unemployed people, are you missing out?
* A developer that spends all day coding, and then needs to do a coding challenge to prove they can code, may decide not to put up with your process
* If you put hiring quality people at a lower priority, maybe you're misunderstanding the value of exceptional developers vs average ones
* Under pressure, can you solve a quiz I just found in a book, and solve it to prove you're worth my time?
* If someone gives you a reference, take the time to call them and find out what kind of person the candidate is
* If a developer wants to forego recruiting that includes code puzzles, they need to ask: Who has the leverage, here?
