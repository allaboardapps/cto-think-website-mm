Randy and Don found themselves stranded, mid-ride on the Expedition Everest rollercoaster at Disney World's Animal Kingdom. Following their rescue, and during an in-person recording from Orlando, they talk about how a tech manager should handle technical downtime, service interruptions, and critical alerts for users, executives, and investors that depend on services.

#### Notes

* Randy and Don were stranded on the Expedition Everest rollercoaster mid-ride due to mechanical failure.
* For the first 10 to 15 minutes, there was no indication that there was a problem at all.
* What is the best way to communicate to users, to managers, to employees when things are not going well.
* When it breaks down, you give the first message of "Something is wrong. You're perfectly safe."
* Usually your upstream provider is the source of most uptime issues.
* For outages, you tend to set a routine amount of time between messages to the stakeholders.
* Sometimes upstream providers will contact your clients before you have a chance to respond to the issue.
* If you send too many notices, stakeholders may tune you out.
* Define the level of urgency of communications is important, but don't leave things above normal too long.
* Having an SOP standard operating procedure is important for folks that are new to a role at the wrong time.
* Disaster recovery plans are different, because they tend to cover scenarios where a major problem has caused damage.
* A paper copy is necessary due to the fact that online access might be blocked during downtime.
* Breach protocol is another type of process necessary for handling technical issues.
* How much information should you give people about what caused the situation?
* Don't try to walk Disney's Animal Kingdom Expedition Everest ride. The rollercoaster is more fun.
* Don experienced a communications issue with the Orlando City MLS team during opening night.
* Setting expectations for users is by far the most important goal early in the downtime communication process.
* Canned messages are typical, because they don't deviate from the message you need to convey.
* Content of messages is also important and consideration of internationalization and multiple languages may be necessary.
* Don't make your users ask, "what the heck are they talking about?" during crisis communications.
* Don't bore your users with repetitive, non-informative content.
* Consider various stakeholders that need to know about the situation. Owners, investors, users, and managers all need different type of info regarding the problems and solutions.
* What channels do you use to distribute communications: email, slack, message boards, ios notifications, android notifications, SMS, push and pull, status page.
* Make sure your status page provider isn't using the same upstream providers that your service is using.
* Know your stakeholders well enough for who needs to know what or who doesn't care.
* Trying to control the entire narrative of the problem can be problematic or even impossible.
* A good post mortem (hindsight report about the outcome) is helpful to explain the problems and the steps you're taking to prevent them in the future.
