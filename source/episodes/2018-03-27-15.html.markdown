#### Notes

* We aren't attorneys and any statements related to the legal side of the NDA/NCA debate should be discussed with one.
* The algorithm a firm uses may be custom and considered protective property and they want an agreement with employees to prevent its release
* The NDA protects the knowledge; The NCA protects the experience
* You may be beholden to a contract between an employer and their client, but you didn't actually sign an agreement
* California has a reputation with Non-compete agreements because of the Silcon Valley history with employment lawsuits
* These types of agreements have a reputation for being difficult to enforce
* Laws like these are created to help the well-behaved people stay behaved. Bad actors will still misbehave.
* An NDA is one way for a firm to tell you "this is knowledge that is important to us"
* I have never signed the first draft of an NDA provided to me
* Using empathy, a startup founder is learning how to run a business, take an idea and make it a reality
* There are people in the ear of the founder telling them to get an NDA signed by anyone they speak with
* Founders often think that the idea is more important than the execution
* There's a fear that talking to a developer, someone that can execute, is of higher risk than talking to someone else
* The business leader doesn't trust you, yet, because they have no reason to
* The contract issuer is attempting to engage with you on a business agreement of some kind, which is what you're trying to do anyways
* Consider not rejecting the NDA at the outset; instead, consider engaging with the other person to gauge their business acumen and communication skills
* If the agreement document is significantly long, ask them to pay for an attorney to review the document
* If the document is short, review and redline it and teach the person where there are issues
* Let the contract issuer to know how their document may not even work
* Aim for a discussion to ensue where both parties can get to know each other and about business-level items, constructive criticism, and see how they deal with feedback
* Have a conversation about business trust as soon as possible. A proposed NDA or NCA is an opportunity to do that.
* Saying "never" about business practices is a pretty broad statement, anyways
* Set a precendent about the NDA/NCA and don't leave the issuer hanging on why you're hesitating to sign
* Regardless of any agreement or lack thereof, don't disclose the private and strategic information about firms for which you work
* Non-disclosure should be part of your business practice regardless of any agreement you have or have not signed
* Developers tend to have greater access to both tech secrets and data secrets, which can have a big impact on firms
* Someone without much leverage, like a job-seeker may have less ability to push back
* Pay attention to how broad a market the document is trying to cover
* Feel free to ask questions about the document at the very least
* Seek outside advice, such as an attorney, who can help explain how an agreement may affect you
* What is the scope of the document from a proximity: The world, the country, the city?
* How much of the marketplace does the document cover or is it just a niche?
* Does the document describe the penalities involved in a breach?
* What is the length of time for the enforcement for the contract?
* What happens if the employment fails after one month? Can you live with the terms even in that scenario?
* If someone gives you an NDA/NCA before a meeting and won't give you the time to read it completely before signing, you should refuse to sign it
* Everyone deserves the time to review a legal agreement, regardless of employment leverage
