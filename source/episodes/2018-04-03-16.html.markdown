#### Notes

* At a company, ethical behavior starts at the top
* Being ethical at the beginning of a firm is easy compared to the grey areas that show up as features and marketplace opportunities evolve
* External partners with different ethics can put pressure on a firm that is trying to be ethical in its own actions
* There's no solid lines for determining ethical behavior. The law can't handle it all.
* Google's Don't Be Evil slogan did us all a disservice by taking a vague stand.
* Doing harm and being evil are not necessarily the same thing.
* Often the problem is that company leaders determine what's ethical based solely on how they feel about things. They leave empathy out of the determination.
* When you join a firm that has a "trial period" it's also your opportunity to research the ethics of the firm and find out if you want to work there long term
