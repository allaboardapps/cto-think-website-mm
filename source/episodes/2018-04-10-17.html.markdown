#### Notes

* We've started a new podcast! Check out [This Old App](https://thisoldapp.online) and subscribe!
* This Old App is more of a grab-bag of in-depth technical discussion, more details, more guests, less structure. (more fun?)
* Firebase has an authentication feature built-in for folks using the service
* The auth piece of an MVP product is something that should not be done half-assed
* Professional authentication/authorization is something every startup should take seriously, especially at the beginning
* Often auth systems are stuck in a bad place because nobody wants to make major changes to the user auth workflow
* When you're an admin on so many services, you have a higher level of responsibility to be secure-minded with all of your credentials
