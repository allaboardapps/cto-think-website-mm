#### Notes

* You don't have to go to a bunch of meetups cold turkey. You can ease yourself into the routine of attending more public events.
* A benefit of networking is hearing about other people's mistakes and then not following in those mistakes. People are a lot more frank about failures when talking in-person.
* Having someone vouch for you is a big difference for getting past anonymous screening processes.
* Going to a meetup is much less about the topic being discussed and more about visiting an office you've never set foot in before, meeting other people, and not needing to talk to other folks the whole time.
